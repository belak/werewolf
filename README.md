# Werewolf: An Artisnal Web-based outliner

This is a WIP web outliner that I plan on using to help augment how I approach large systems and long term projects.

Planned features include being able to clone/mirror nodes across multiplace places in the outline, making sure that the outliner works serviceably on mobile, and adding support for running Lua scripts to automate parts of working on the outline. I also want to use this as a tool for building software. I was inspired by a Python/Desktop based outliner (I forget the anme)

Right now, this is pre-0.1, barely anything works other than displaying the outline, the tests are still in a messy state, and so on. Caveat Emptor. 

In the future, I'd like to turn this into a nice set of tools for planning, outlining, building software systems, and making checklists. But that is a process that will take quite some time. So, for now, I'm building it out slowly, and trying to get time in on it where it makes sense. 

## Crazy ideas for down the road

- Vim keybindings for editing text
- a TUI for editing the outline, so that the Web GUI isn't required
- Some sort of query language for getting lists of nodes
